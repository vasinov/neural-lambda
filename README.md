# Machine Learning with Amazon Lambda

### Introduction

You might have noticed that we at 2lemetry are pretty excited about Amazon's newest AWS product [Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Several of our engineers [experimented](http://2lemetry.com/tag/lambda/) with how lambdas work together with the MQTT protocol and [ThingFabric](https://app.thingfabric.com). I decided to work on a small experiment with real computations to see how neural networks can be used inside lambdas in the context of the Internet of Things. I'm going to heavily utilize the S3/MQTT foundation described by Kyle, our CEO, in his recent [blog post](http://2lemetry.com/2014/12/05/native-mqtt-lambda/).
